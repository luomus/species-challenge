# 100 Species Challenge Web App

The 100 Species Challenge web app is designed to facilitate wildlife observation challenges, specifically focused on observing 100 species. These challenges, open to the general public, encourage participants to observe and document 100 different species of plants, fungi, or insects over the course of a year.

The app allows administrators to create and manage multiple challenges, and users can participate in one or more challenges simultaneously. Participants can enter their name or nickname, location, and observed species with dates. The app tracks progress, showing who has completed the challenge, along with an aggregated list of all observed species. Users can also compare their personal observations against the total species recorded in each challenge.

The backend is built using Flask, with MariaDB as the database, and is designed to run on the Rahti 2 OpenShift environment provided by CSC. User authentication is handled through the FinBIF Laji-auth service (Laji.fi).

The 100 Species Challenge (100 lajia -haaste) project is funded by [Kone Foundation, 2023](https://koneensaatio.fi/en/grants-and-residencies/sata-lajia-haaste-2/). The live production version is available at https://100lajia.luomus.fi

## Development setup

- Clone this repository `git clone ...`
- Switch to dev branch `git checkout dev`
- Optionally change development database password to `docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init_db.sql`
- Set up environment variables to `.env.` and `playwright.example` Use example files as templates.
- Build Docker image `docker build -t species-challenge:latest .`
- Startup with one of these commands:
    - With Playwright: `docker-compose up build playwright; docker-compose down;`
    - Without Playwright: `docker-compose up; docker-compose down;`
- Set up database:
    - phpMyAdmin is available at http://localhost:8080
    - Import file from Â´./sql/species_challenge_dev.sqlÂ´

Site will be visible http://localhost:8081

phpMyAdmin admin UI will be at http://localhost:8080 

## Running tests

- Run the app with `docker-compose up; docker-compose down;`
- Login to playwright container with `docker exec -ti species-challenge-playwright-1 bash`
- Run tests with `python -m pytest -v -s`. The `-s` option enables print outputs.

## Deploying to Rahti 2

- Run e2e-tests
- Merge changes to main, if deploying production version
- Check that build is successful at https://github.com/luomus/species-challenge/actions
- Select deployment from https://console-openshift-console.apps.2.rahti.csc.fi/k8s/ns/species-challenge/deployments
- Actions > Restart rollout
- Check that everything works

## OpenShift setup notes

Note that in order to create MariaDB database on Rahti, PHPMyAdmin data dump does not work. You need to create the dump on the command line:

    mariadb-dump --user=USERNAME --password --lock-tables --databases DATABASENAME > ./species-challenge.sql


## Notes

- Setting up new challenge
    - Provide list of basic taxa to `app/data/`, e.g. `plantae_2024.json` or use one of the existing ones.
    - Provide list of all allowed taxa to `app/data/` (for backend) and `static/taxa/` (for frontend autocomplete), e.g. `plantae_2024_all.json`. This must contain all taxa that the basic list above contains, icnluding non-species.
- Challenges-table has field for autocomplete-parameters, but these are not currently used. Instead autocomplete uses static file as described above. This is to 
    - Make it faster than API calls (nearly instantaneous)
    - Allow more flexibility, e.g. having only few higher taxa in addition to species
- The UI prevents setting dates that are outside the challenge dates, and dates in the future. This relies on min & max attributes on the date field and browser validation and error messages, and has limitations based on browser.
- When challenge is in draft or closed state, editing it still needs to be possible, e.g. to anonymize or trash it. Therefore only editing species list is disabled by setting the date fields disabled, and not enabling  Javascript to change them either.

#### Future: To have a new challenge type, you would need to:

- Define new types to data/challenge_vocabulary.json
- When loading participation edit form, load the challenge data to see the type
    - Router calls a helper, passes this data also to method
- On router, select template based on the type
    - Template includes additional fields (no rendering same field differently, that would create complexity)
- On method, select type-specific validator (using a function that passes the validator) to validate participation data
- This way form template and validator make sure the data is always ok.
- SQL inset & update queries need to be duplicated or automated.
- So data structure need to be defined in four places
    - Database: new fields
    - Form: new fields and UI
    - Validator: field values
    - Database query: fields and values

## Todo

### Next

* Fix autocomplete-added species min/max dates being 2022-??
* Refactor trashing. Now issues with 
    * Should removal be completely different procedure, that only UPDATES trashed = 1, and does not UPDATE anything else?
    * field value can be "1" or true, "0" or false
    * If user removes name and then trashes the participation, saving fails, and some data disappears.
* Trim whitespace from MX codes, both on read and write
* On Safari, scroll date errors in view: https://chat.openai.com/share/cf043643-8b07-4394-b10e-30a383d54479
* On safari, autocomplete shows list bullets

### Setup

- Version numbering?
- More robust error handling and restart? Try with triggering syntax error.
- Database sorting/collation settings utf8mb4_swedish_ci?
- Backup monitoring

### Features todo

- Test:
    - Automated testing with Playwright
        - Admin editing challenges (requires setting up admin username limited to this system & saving that to Playwright env)
- For 2025:
    - Handling higher taxa (is uses adds rikkavoikukka, don't add voikukat to taxon_count)
    - Accessibility
    - Challenge sort order (int) for the front page - larger number shown on top
- Later / nice:
    - Todo if simple form fullness verification field is not enough: Calculate taxon count on frontend, make backend validate this is same as taxa with dates.
    - Show challenge days also on participation form (in case challenge is open, but challenge period has not yet started)
    - If today is not within date begin and end, don't update taxon datw by clicking taxon name (now updates, but browser validation then prevents saving)
    - Move login_url, api_url, target id yms. konfiguraatiotiedostoon
    - Own data dump download
    - Admin ability to edit any participations
    - My participation species accumulation chart
    - Activity stats, e.g. users active during last 7 days, new participations
    - Maybe: Move observed species list away from challenge main page to separate page, preparing for tables that have >200 observers and species
